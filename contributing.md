## üó∫Ô∏èContributing Guidelines

### üö©GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/issues) page has all of the bugs and enhancements that we want to implement. We have labels that split them into the following categories:

- enhancements: improvements to existing features or altogether new features

If you are working on an issue, please assign to yourself! And please keep issues as modular/focused as possible.

We've marked the issues that we would love folks to work on first with 'good first issue' - see [here](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for all such issues.
