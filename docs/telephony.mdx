# Overview

Vocode supports using agents with inbound and outbound phone calls. Users
can [create their own agents](/create-your-own-agent) and use them
to fulfill a variety of use cases like information collection, appointment scheduling,
sales, customer support, and more.

In this guide, we'll go over how to do inbound and outbound phone calls both self-hosted
and hosted.

# Self-hosted

## Requirements

1. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (used to host the `TelephonyServer` locally)
2. [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
   a. If you have Homebrew installed, run `brew install ffmpeg`
3. [Redis](https://redis.com/)
   a. If you have Homebrew installed, run `brew install redis`
4. (optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Environments

1. Copy the `.env.template` file and fill in the values of your API keys. You'll need to get API keys for:

- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) (for speech transcription)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) (for the underlying agent)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/) (for speech synthesis)
- [Twilio](https://console.twilio.com/) (for telephony)

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

2. Set up hosting so that Twilio can hit your server. An easy way to do this is `ngrok`: in our code we set it up to be running on port 3000, run:

```
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the URL that is tunneling localhost:3000 to your `.env` without `https://`, e.g.

```
BASE_URL=asdf1234.ngrok.app
```

## Telephony Server

The `TelephonyServer` is–as implied by the name–a server that is responsible for
receiving and making phone calls.
The server is built using FastAPI and utilizes Twilio for telephony services.

Clone the Vocode repo or copy the [Telephony app](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/tree/main/apps/telephony_app) directory.

### Running the server

Pick one of these two ways to run the server: 1. Run everything with Docker, 2. Run Python directly

#### Option 1: Run everything With Docker

1. Build the telephony app Docker image. From the `telephony_app` directory, run:

```bash
docker build -t vocode-telephony-app .
```

2. Run the application using `docker-compose`. From the `telephony_app` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

#### Option 2: Run Python directly

Run the following steps from the `telephony_app` directory.

1. Create a Python environment (we recommend using `virtualenv` by running `python3 -m venv venv`) and install dependencies via `pip`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run Redis with the default port of 6379.

For example, using Homebrew:

```
brew services start redis
```

Or if you prefer to use Docker for this part:

```
docker run -dp 6379:6379 -it redis/redis-stack:latest
```

3. Load the environment variables

```
source .env
```

4. Run the server with `uvicorn` (should be already installed in step 1).

```
uvicorn main:app --port 3000
```

### Setting up an inbound number

1. Create a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account
2. Once inside your dashboard, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Buy a number to get a phone number.
3. Then, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Active Numbers and select the number you want to set up.
4. Update the config to point the Webhook URL to `https://<YOUR BASE URL>/inbound_call` - if you're using `ngrok`, it looks like `https://asdf1234.ngrok.app/inbound_call`

![Setup](/images/twilio_number_config.png)

5. Hit **Save** and call the number!

### Executing outbound calls

Make sure the server we just set up is already running. Then, in `outbound_call.py`

1. Replace the `to_phone` with the number you want to call and the `from_phone` with the number you want to call from.
   In order to make a call from the `to_phone`, you must have access to it via Twilio (either a number purchased via Twilio or verify the caller ID).

> Note: To ensure legal compliance with robocall regulations in California, the following code snippet from the [Vocode library](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/blob/main/vocode/streaming/telephony/conversation/outbound_call.py#L83-L96) utilizes Twilio Line Intelligence to check if calls are made to mobile phones: For Canadian phone numbers, the Twilio Lookup API may not return carrier data due to the Canadian Local Number Portability Consortium (CLNPC) requirements. More information on this issue can be found in the [Twilio Support Article](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004563433-Twilio-Lookup-API-is-Not-Returning-Carrier-Data-for-Canadian-Phone-Numbers).

2. Install `python-dotenv` to use the environment variables we set up earlier.

```
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

Run the script with `python3 outbound_call.py`.

### Configuration

Both the `OutboundCall` (in `outbound_call.py`) and `InboundCallConfig` (in `telephony_app.py`) classes can accept a `TranscriberConfig`, `AgentConfig`
or `SynthesizerConfig` - the default transcriber is Deepgram and the default synthesizer is Azure.

This example sets up an agent that spells every word that is sent to it - any text-in, text-out function can be turned into a voice conversation by subclassing `BaseAgent` and creating an `AgentFactory`.

```
class SpellerAgentConfig(AgentConfig, type="agent_speller"):
    pass


class SpellerAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, agent_config: SpellerAgentConfig):
        super().__init__(agent_config=agent_config)

    async def respond(
        self,
        human_input,
        conversation_id: str,
        is_interrupt: bool = False,
    ) -> Tuple[Optional[str], bool]:
        return "".join(c + " " for c in human_input), False


class SpellerAgentFactory(AgentFactory):
    def create_agent(self, agent_config: AgentConfig) -> BaseAgent:
        return SpellerAgent(agent_config=agent_config)
```

An `AgentFactory` instance is passed into the `TelephonyServer` in `telephony_app.py`.

We provide a small set of agents with already created `AgentConfig`s, including, importantly, one that sets up ChatGPT with a configured prompt: see our `Python Quickstart` for more info.

#### Accessing call information in your agent

We store the `to` and `from` numbers in the [`ConfigManager`](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python-sdk/blob/b37bf7a1172a917b641d0e70ba14756415e09b0b/apps/telephony_app/main.py#L20) - so
if you'd like to access them in your agent, you can instantiate the manager to hook into the same Redis instance:

```
class SpellerAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, agent_config: SpellerAgentConfig):
        super().__init__(agent_config=agent_config)
        self.config_manager = RedisConfigManager()

    async def respond(
        self,
        human_input,
        conversation_id: str,
        is_interrupt: bool = False,
    ) -> Tuple[Optional[str], bool]:
        call_config = self.config_manager.get_config(conversation_id)
        if call_config is not None:
            from_phone = call_config.twilio_from
            to_phone = call_config.twilio_to
        return "".join(c + " " for c in human_input), False
```

## Authentication

Head to our [dashboard](https://app.vocode.dev) to get an API key.

To use your API key, set the API key on the module as follows:

```python
import vocode
vocode.api_key = '{YOUR_API_KEY}'
```

## Outbound Calls

The `OutboundCall` class provides a simple abstraction for creating outbound calls.

### OutboundCall Class

<ParamField path="recipient" type="CallEntity" required={true}>
  The recipient entity for the phone call.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="caller" type="CallEntity" required={true}>
  The caller entity for the phone call.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="agent_config" type="AgentConfig" required={true}>
  The configuration for the AI agent.
</ParamField>

### Example: Making an outbound call

```python
import os
from vocode.streaming.telephony.hosted.outbound_call import OutboundCall
from vocode.streaming.models.agent import ChatGPTAgentConfig
from vocode.streaming.models.telephony import CallEntity, TwilioConfig
from vocode.streaming.models.message import BaseMessage

import vocode
vocode.api_key = '{YOUR_API_KEY}'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    call = OutboundCall(
        recipient=CallEntity(
            phone_number="+12345678900",
        ),
        caller=CallEntity(
            phone_number="+12345678900",
        ),
        agent_config=ChatGPTAgentConfig(
            initial_message=BaseMessage(text="Hello!"),
            prompt_preamble="Have a pleasant conversation about life",
        ),
        twilio_config=TwilioConfig(
            account_sid=os.getenv("TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"),
            auth_token=os.getenv("TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"),
        )
    )
    call.start()
    input("Press enter to end the call...")
    call.end()
```

## Inbound Calls

The `InboundCallServer` class provides a simple abstraction to create an endpoint that can host your agent
to respond to inbound calls. In order to implement an inbound call agent, start by defining an `InboundCallServer`
like so:

```python
from vocode.streaming.telephony.hosted.inbound_call_server import InboundCallServer
from vocode.streaming.models.agent import EchoAgentConfig
from vocode.streaming.models.message import BaseMessage
from vocode.streaming.models.telephony import TwilioConfig

if __name__ == '__main__':
    server = InboundCallServer(
        agent_config=EchoAgentConfig(initial_message=BaseMessage(text="hello!")),
        twilio_config=TwilioConfig(
            account_sid=os.getenv("TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"),
            auth_token=os.getenv("TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"),
        )
    )
    server.run(port=3000)
```

This spins up a FastAPI web server with a `/vocode` route that returns a TwiML object that we will need in the next
step. If you're using our [Replit template](https://replit.com/@vocode/Inbound-Call-Server), this is already set up for you!

Next, we'll set up a programmable phone number on Twilio that can accept the TwiML object from
above. To do this,

1. Create a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account
2. Find your Twilio credentials: this is found on under _Account Info_ in the dashboard.
   > Tip: if you already have existing Twilio integrations, set up the number in a [subaccount](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011132374-Getting-Started-with-Twilio-Accounts-and-Subaccounts)
3. Set up `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment. If you're using Replit, use [Replit secrets](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/workspace-features/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables). Otherwise, packages like [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) are useful for this.
4. Once inside your dashboard, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Buy a number to get a phone number.
5. Then, go to Phone Numbers -> Manage -> Active Numbers and select the number you want to set up.
6. Update the config to point the Webhook URL to the `/vocode` route we just set up. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) one option to quickly to host the server.
   > If you're using the Replit template, use the provided hosted URL that looks something like `https://<repl>.<username>.repl.co/vocode`
7. Hit **Save** and call the number!
