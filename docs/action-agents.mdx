## What are actions?

Actions refer to specific tools an agent can execute during the conversation. These actions can encompass various activities like writing an email,
scheduling an appointment, and so forth. They are implemented as classes derived from the `BaseAction` class.

The `BaseAction` class is defined as follows:

```python
class BaseAction(Generic[ActionOutputType]):
    def run(self, params: str) -> ActionOutputType:
        raise NotImplementedError
```

Every action class derived from BaseAction must implement the run method, which is called to execute the action.
Importantly, each action class should include a docstring for this method that explains the expected parameters.
This docstring is critical as it provides the information that the AI will consume in its prompt when instructing the execution of the action.

## `ActionAgent`

The `ActionAgent` is responsible for managing and executing actions within a conversation. The agent consumes a configuration object at instantiation,
which specifies the actions that the agent can perform.

The agent configuration, ActionAgentConfig, lists the actions available to the agent:

```python
class ActionAgentConfig(AgentConfig, type=AgentType.ACTION):
    actions: List[ActionType]
    model_name: str = ACTION_AGENT_DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME
    temperature: float = LLM_AGENT_DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE
    max_tokens: int = LLM_AGENT_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS
```

## `ActionsWorker`: how actions are executed and consumed

The `ActionsWorker` class plays a crucial role in the async processing of actions within the system. It's a specialized form of the `InterruptibleWorker` class,
designed to handle the execution of actions and passing results back to the `ActionAgent`.

The `ActionsWorker` is initialized with an input queue and an output queue. It uses an `ActionFactory` instance to create and execute actions based on the inputs it receives.

The flow of actions is as follows:

1. `ActionAgent` sends action requests to the `ActionsWorker` through the worker's input queue.
2. `ActionsWorker` reads the action request from the input queue. It then creates an instance of the appropriate action using the `ActionFactory`, and executes it using the provided parameters.
3. The executed action returns an `ActionOutput` object which encapsulates the result of the action.
4. `ActionsWorker` creates an `ActionResultAgentInput` from the `ActionOutput`, and puts it in its output queue.
5. The `ActionAgent` then consumes the `ActionResultAgentInput` from the queue in its process method. This
   result is added to the transcript of the conversation, and can influence the behavior of the `ActionAgent` in subsequent interactions.

### Implementing your own action: Nylas email example

In this section, we provide an example of an action, `NylasSendEmail`, which extends the `BaseAction` class. It implements the run method to send an email using the Nylas API.

```python
class NylasSendEmail(BaseAction[NylasSendEmailActionOutput]):
    def run(self, params: str) -> NylasSendEmailActionOutput:
        """Sends an email using Nylas API.
        The input to this action is a pipe separated list of the recipient email, email body, optional subject. But always include
        the pipe character even if the subject or message IDs are not included and just leave it blank.
        The subject should only be included if it is a new email thread.
        If there is no message id, the email will be sent as a new email. Otherwise, it will be sent as a reply to the given message. Make sure to include the previous message_id
        if you are replying to an email.

        For example, `recipient@example.com|Hello, this is the email body.|this is the subject` would send an email to recipient@example.com with the provided body and subject.
        """
        recipient_email, email_body, email_subject = params.split("|")

        from nylas import APIClient

        # Initialize the Nylas client
        nylas = APIClient(
            client_id=os.getenv("NYLAS_CLIENT_ID"),
            client_secret=os.getenv("NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET"),
            access_token=os.getenv("NYLAS_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
        )

        # Create the email draft
        draft = nylas.drafts.create()
        draft.body = email_body

        draft.subject = (
            email_subject.strip() if email_subject.strip() else "Email from Vocode"
        )
        draft.to = [{"email": recipient_email.strip()}]

        # Send the email
        draft.send()

        return NylasSendEmailActionOutput(response=json.dumps({"success": True}))
```
