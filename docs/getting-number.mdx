If you're on the Free plan, you'll have to head to the [dashboard](https://app.vocode.dev) to buy numbers. The Developer and
Enterprise plans both come with numbers included in the subscription. For more info, see [Pricing](https://vocode.dev/pricing).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
phone_number = vocode_client.numbers.buy_number()
```

```typescript TypeScript
const phoneNumber = await vocode.numbers.buyNumber();
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.vocode.dev/v1/numbers/buy \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

</CodeGroup>

You'll get a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "***",
  "user_id": "***",
  "number": "11234567890",
  "inbound_agent": {...}
}
```
