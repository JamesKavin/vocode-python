# Introduction

This example shows how to use Vocode as a tool augmenting the abilities of a Langchain
agent. By providing it with access to Vocode, a [Langchain Agent](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html)
can now make autonomous phone calls and take action based on the outcome of the calls.

Our demo will walk through how to instruct the agent to lookup a phone number and make the
appropriate call.

# How to run it

## Requirements

1. Install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
2. Install [Redis](https://redis.com/)

## Run the example

Note: GPT-4 is required for this to work.

1. Clone the Vocode repo or copy the [Langchain agent app](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python/tree/main/apps/langchain_agent)
   directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-python.git
```

2. Install requirements inside of the `agent_demo/requirements.txt`

```bash
agent_demo % pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Expose your local server to the internet with Ngrok:

In a new terminal window, navigate to the directory where Ngrok is installed and run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI key>"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="<your Deepgram key>"
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY="<your Azure key>"
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION="<your Azure region>"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="<your Twilio account sid>"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="<your Twilio auth token>"
TELEPHONY_SERVER_BASE_URL="<your Ngrok base URL>" # does not include https://
OUTBOUND_CALLER_NUMBER="<your verified outbound number on Twilio>"
```

Note: In order to make a call from the `OUTBOUND_CALLER_NUMBER`, you must have access to it via Twilio (either a number purchased via Twilio
or verify the caller ID).

5. Run the `TelephonyServer`:

In a separate terminal window run

```bash
uvicorn examples.agent_demo.telephony_app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Note: if you are inside of `agent_demo/`, you can drop the `examples.agent_demo` bit

6. Update the phone numbers in the contact book in `agent_demo/tools/contacts.py`

```python
CONTACTS = [{"name": "Kian", "phone": "+123456789"}]
```

7. In a new terminal, run `main.py`

```bash
python examples/agent_demo/main.py
```
