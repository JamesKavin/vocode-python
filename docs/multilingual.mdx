Vocode bots speak English by default but they can be configured to speak and understand
different languages. This feature is in beta and is currently being worked on. As of right now,
this feature works best with ElevenLabs multilingual voices.

# Supported Languages

Right now, our supported languages include:

- English
- Spanish
- German

with plans to support more in the future. If you have any particular requests, please email support@vocode.dev.

# Set agent language

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from vocode import AgentUpdateParams

language = "es" # ["en", "es", "de"]
number = vocode_client.numbers.update_number(
    phone_number="YOUR_NUMBER", inbound_agent=AgentUpdateParams(language=language)
)
```

```javascript TypeScript
const language = "es"; // ["en", "es", "de"]
const number = await vocode.numbers.updateNumber({
  phoneNumber: "YOUR_NUMBER",
  inboundAgent: { language: language },
});
```
