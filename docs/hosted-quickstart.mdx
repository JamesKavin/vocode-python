# Introduction

The Vocode hosted service allows you to automate inbound and outbound phone calls
via our API and SDKs. You can configure agents to answer phone calls (inbound) or make
phone calls on your behalf (outbound).

The hosted API is built to be scalable and production ready. Vocode provides guardrails
to make sure agents perform the intended goals reliably and metrics to analyze performance.

# Getting started

To get started with Vocode, you can start by installing either of our Python or Node SDKs, or
hitting the API directly.

### Python

Install the `vocode-api` package using a package manager.

<CodeGroup>
```bash poetry
poetry add vocode-api
```

```bash pip
pip install vocode-api
```

</CodeGroup>

Initialize the Vocode client like so:

```python
from vocode.client import Vocode

vocode_client = Vocode(
  token="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

list_numbers_response = vocode_client.numbers.list_numbers()

print(list_numbers_response)
```

### Node

Install the `vocode-api` package using a package manager.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install --save @vocode/vocode-api
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @vocode/vocode-api
```

</CodeGroup>

Initialize the Vocode client like so:

```typescript
import { VocodeClient } from "@vocode/vocode-api";

const vocode = new VocodeClient({
  token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

vocode.numbers.listNumbers().then((numbers) => {
  console.log("My numbers:", numbers);
});
```

### API Reference

If you'd prefer to hit our API directly, take a look at our [API Reference](/api-reference).

# Hosted Walkthrough

Once you have Vocode installed, we suggest going through the [Hosted Walkthrough](/getting-number) which will
show you how to start interacting with the API.
