title: "HIPAA Compliance"
---

The `hipaa_compliant` flag in the Vocode outbound calls API configures the system to not
persist any potentially sensitive information. Turning on the flag makes the API supportable for use-cases requiring HIPAA compliance.

In particular, turning on the flag:

- Redacts the content of the prompt on the `calls` resource
- Prevents the transcript from being written to the `calls` resource
- Configures the call not to be recorded

# Turning on the flag

```python
vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=...,
    hipaa_compliant=True
)
```
