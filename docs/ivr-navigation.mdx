title: "[Beta] IVR Navigation"
description: "Navigate phone trees"
---

Note: this feature is only useful on outbound calls, which are disabled by default. Please contact us through Discord or at support@vocode.dev
to discuss enabling outbound calls for your account!

The Vocode API has many tools for agents to interact with IVRs (interactive voice responses) - navigating phone trees
is one of the primary use-cases of the API.

# IVR navigation mode

When starting an outbound call, set `ivr_navigation_mode` to `default` - this allows the bot to stay silent while on hold. Vocode
bots also automatically end the call after the conversation has been idle (i.e. no words on both sides) for 30 seconds: setting `ivr_navigation_mode` to `default`
increases this threshold to 10 minutes.

```python
vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        ...,
        ivr_navigation_mode="default"
    ),
)
```

# DTMF action

The DTMF action allows the bot to hit dial tones (e.g. to navigate phone tree nodes where an IVR says "Press 1 for ...").

```python
vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        actions=[DtmfActionParams(type="action_dtmf")],
        ...
    ),
)
```

# Transfer call action

The Transfer call action allows the bot to transfer to a human agent.

```python
vocode_client.calls.create_call(
    from_number="<YOUR VOCODE NUMBER>",
    to_number="15555555555",
    agent=CreateCallAgentParams(
        actions=[TransferCallActionParams(type="action_transfer_call", config=TransferCallConfig(
            phone_number="11234567890"
        ))],
        ...
    ),
)
```

# On the horizon

We plan to introduce more dials here, for example:

- More configurability around allowed idle time of the conversation
- Human detection - i.e. behavior when a human picks up the phone after the bot navigates the phone tree
